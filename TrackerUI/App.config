     <!--
      When this was not working, I had the connectionString as
      connectionString=".\Server=5CG11715DR;....
      
      but it started working when I deleted what .\
      not sure actually why. I got the idea to delete it from checking the Properties of the database
      and seeing that .\ was NOT in the connectionstring that was shown in the Properties-->
      <add name ="Tournaments" connectionString="Server=5CG11715DR;Database=Tournaments;Trusted_Connection=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
